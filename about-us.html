          <h2> About GoSukkah</h2>
          <p> GoSukkah is dedicated to provide the people of <em> Am Yisrael</em> (Nation of Israel) with a protective temporary dwelling place, <em> The Sukkah</em>, in order to experience the joyous festival of <em> Sukkot </em>. Just as G-d protected our forefathers for 40 years in the wilderness under <em> Sukkot</em>, GoSukkah promises to craft dwellings that will protect Am Yisrael under <em>Sukkot</em>. </p>
          <!-- New Paragraph-->
          <p > Along with the service of constructing durable kosher <em>Sukkot</em>, GoSukkah also offers various holiday related items for purchase.</p>
          <!-- New Paragraph-->
          <p>Unlike traditional <em>Sukkah</em> builders, GoSukkah provides extraordinary convenience, quality experience and fine customer service. Our mission is to make the people of <em> Am Yisrael</em> our trusted partners this holiday season. </p>

      <h2 class="heading"> Our Culture</h2>
          <p class="p1"> GoSukkah is proud of its roots. Started by 3 Yeshiva boys in High School Nati Aharonoff, Joe Piroozian, and Isaac Yehoshua- GoSukkah now employs over 15 Yeshiva University students- who are all dedicated to Torah, Mitzvot and of course building kosher, beautiful <em>Sukkot</em>!</p> 
      <!--Some more verbage-->
      <h2 class="heading"> Community </h2>
          <p class="p1"> We feel that all of <em> Am Israel </em> should have the opportunity to spend the holiday with joy. To do our part in making this a reality, we donate 10% of all profit to  <a href="http://www.tsqinc.org/"> <em> Tomchei Shabbos</em> </a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing Shabbat and Holiday meals to countless Jews in need.</p>
